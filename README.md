#KiWi - A corpus and concordance generation web application

A web application in Java that provides corpus and concordance generation functionality to registered users. The application is intended for professional translators, who once registered, can generate their own corpora by uploading txt, html or pdf files. The user can then search the corpus for two or more words in context. The full-text search algorithm will match any substring, not just seperate words. KiWi uses a suffix array to provide the core functionality. The implementation of the suffix array is by [Sedgwick & Kayne](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/63suffix/SuffixArrayX.java.html)
